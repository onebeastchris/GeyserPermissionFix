# LuckLink

This Geyser Extension allows you to automatically register permissions defined by Geyser - e.g. Geyser commands - 
or other Geyser extensions to Luckperms. This only needs to be done on platforms that do not have a native permission manager.
These include Velocity, BungeeCord, and Fabric. Spigot/Paper and Geyser-Standalone have native permission managers.

## This extension will only work after [this PR](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/3808) is merged.

### Installation
Download the latest .jar from the releases tab here, and place it in your Geyser's `extensions` folder.

### Configuration
No configuration necessary. Just ensure that you have Luckperms installed on your server.
